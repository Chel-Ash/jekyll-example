Oscar attends the funeral of Dwight's Aunt Shirley at Schrute Farms. Dwight's sister Fannie and brother Jeb also attend and Shirley stipulates in her will that they are set to inherit her farm only if they choose to live and work it themselves. Todd Packer returns to the office to make amends as part of an alcoholic and narcotics recovery process but instead hands out cupcakes laced with laxatives and drugs.
