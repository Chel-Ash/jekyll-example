The office pairs into couples so that they may all be able to take advantage of a Valentine's Day discount at a mini-mall. After Andy returns from his boat trip, Erin decides that she is going to break up with him so that she can be with Pete, but Pete begins to doubt her. Pam and Jim share lunch with Brian, the documentary's sound man.
