Dwight must confront his fear of public speaking when he is named Dunder Mifflin's Salesman of the Year. Pam gets wrapped up with wedding plans, but Jim has plans of a different sort: an escape route for long enough so that he doesn't have to witness Pam's wedding. The staffers battle it out over control of the thermostat.
