Kelly is the bubbly and energetic Customer Service Rep for Dunder Mifflin. She is extremely talkative. In “Drug Testing” she is able to carry on an entire conversation with Jim even though he is unable to speak. She is rather shallow and loves celebrity gossip. In “Grief Counseling” she called Princess Diana’s funeral the saddest ever before remembering her own sisters.

She endures a tumultuous, one-sided relationship with Ryan. She dreams of getting married and having babies after their first date. Ryan breaks up with her to take a job in corporate. She then begins to date Darryl from the warehouse but this relationship also seems to be one-sided and she has the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old.

In “Business Trip” she send a break up text to Darryl who is shown to be more than happy. Despite her naive personality she can be quite vindictive if she doesn’t get her way. She loves fashion shows at lunch and she’s not afraid about trying radical dieting methods like a tapeworm in an effort to lose weight.
