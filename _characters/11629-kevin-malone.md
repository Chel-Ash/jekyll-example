Kevin Malone was an accountant for Dunder Mifflin and was portrayed as a dull, slow-witted, man-child. Kevin enjoys the simple things in life-like sports and candy and even keeps a jar of M&Ms at his desk. He likes to gamble and mentions in “Casino Night” he won a gold bracelet at the World Series of Poker and he has a world famous chili recipe, but sometimes he drops it before it can be eaten.

In “Safety Training” he and Jim start betting on various things around the office. Kevin plays drums in a Police cover band called Scrantonicity and played Phyllis’ wedding. Angela and Oscar are Kevin’s co-workers in accounting and while he gets along with Oscar, Angela views him as dumb and disgusting.

She’s not necessarily wrong though because he does have trouble reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in “Dwight K. Schrute, Acting Manager” and Holly mistook him for being mentally challenged. Kevin’s life ambition is to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs, which is something we can all relate to.
