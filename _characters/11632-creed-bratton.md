Creed Bratton is a mysterious older man who works for Dunder Mifflin. He is rather bizarre makes confusing statements. He a deleted scene in “Christmas Party” he tells Oscar that he used to host a radio show and in another deleted scene from “Booze Cruise” he plays guitar with the ship’s band. Creed keeps to himself but it is revealed that he has a rather dark side to him.

During one Christmas party he asks what kind of gift Santa would bring if he had done something truly evil. He is a terrible employee. He forgets his job in “Goodbye Toby” and gets a paper mill employee fired after he blew off an inspection. He spends most of his time playing solitaire on his computer and manipulates Michael into firing Devon in “Halloween.”

Despite this, Creed is usually in a cheery mood and likes his co-workers, it’s just that most of them don’t like them, especially Ryan who thinks he has an “old man smell.”
